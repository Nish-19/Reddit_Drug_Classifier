Alturism: (e.g. Personal experience)
------------
fbhmcc3 	it does feel hopeless sometimes doesn t it
fbgv0qj 	no wonder i relapsed at # months and i can tell you i swear on my mother i did everything on most people bucket lists
fb944vp 	i made a ton of edibles and have been high non stop since going cold turkey
fb7bkao 	i m still learning how to deal with my emotions sober though
fb79d5u 	ex addict with many years clean here
fb77usc 	i have got ## years under my belt and i have learned that sometimes me trying to help makes things alot worse
fb6zksr 	i lost my mom to opiates i ve also been the addict
fb7aoe1		iv had my parents and sister worrying since i was ## and my girl since i met her
fb7aca1 	i almost threw it all away these last two days i was ready to go back to the gas station and finish what i started 
fb76zez 	days # # we are the worst for me
fb6x4wm 	my best friend who is getting clean helped me come clean to my whole family about everything and while i was on the phone with him he got a call and told me to stay on the line found out it was my dealer 
fb6wf9s 	i remember the # rd time was key i said hey if u really wanna meet up with me that bad today it is gonna be for a fist fight and i am ready to rip somebodys fucken head off 
fb648s7 	then i had # weeks vakay from work and finally got clean otherwise i would still be using
fb98cri 	first time i did suboxone i was having a really bad experience with lyrica last thing i took was ## mg tramadol a couple of times 
fb65pqv		the cycle of use was very much a self fulfilling prophecy where depression fear and anger would inevitably force me back into a place where i d rationalize a reason to use i eventually went on mat which is medicine assisted therapy 
fb6alfg 	yeah i abused drugs for well over a decade but it got really bad from #### to may of ####
fb53lz7 	i had a dark few months and cocooned myself inside my home too often
fb4wbhs 	i ll be # months clean on new years day and i am starting to feel like myself again 
fb50oa9 	i am ## now i totally wasted my years between ## and ## proper fucked them up # prison sentences that leave me with no chance of getting a decent job 
fb6753m 	# week clean first time in four years despite the physical shit and terrible insomnia i feel so much more alive without all the artificial highs followed by despair and dullness and fog
fb4kyu9 	a lot of staying clean for me was that realization and then being real with myself and not leaving any back doors open i smashed my old phone i got into a program

Good Advice: (e.g. imparting information that will help with recovery)
------------
fb8ckyd 	you must get into the recovery scene and make new friends and fill your time do not just go to meetings and sit bored take it in and reach out to the people sitting across from you 
fb70sbl 	in order to keep off the gear it really comes down to what floats your boat what did you enjoy doing seven years ago before the addiction kicked in and do those activities still hold any appeal
fb7daiv 	they obviously administered narcan anyways and when i saw it working it was like nothing i ever felt before like relief and the ground shattering beneath me
fb77usc 	you need to reflect long and hard about what you are going to do with your future good luck
fb6zksr 	Talk to a counselor or go to AlAnon. Keep yourself safe.
fb6vypv 	it would probably be best for op s bf if they get a healthy outlet to express some fear and anger too
fb6vk8c 	it time try to be supportive but be aware i wouldn t focus too much on the betrayal aspect yes he fucked up but you made the decision to be with a recovering addict right have you talked to a counselor about your mom and how that affects your present healing yourself will help your situation too
fb6vk8c 	i would def check out an al anon or nar anon meeting for people who love an addict parent spouse child they re like the graduate program for ## steps
fb7aoe1		it s true we gotta think about the people that care about us and what our use has done to them
fb6w1pw 	maybe you need some kind of action some activities that will be good for you stay strong stay safe
fb648s7 	keeping occupied helps and spending time with my gf keeps me happy
fb73tum 	m just very scared to mess with subs due to getting into precipitated wd and doing that one too many days in the taper causing a month of wd from that even if mild i ve never and never will dose more than # days in a row
fb6uci2 	you may think you cannot get addicted on benzos but once you get the rebound anxiety after frequent use you will get hooked without even expecting it
fb6i4wj 	when u switch from say oxy or heroin to bupe sometimes it s even harder to quit bupe because it has a way longer half life and you will get sick after you make ur body is dependent on bupe too that s why the best way is to taper down with bupe since u don t get so high from it but to cut down slowly so ur not dependent on bupe also when ur done with it
fb6bvm4 	i don t think playing w something that s gonna give me bad paws and even more wd is worth it
fb6s200 	you ll have to go through some discomfort to get to the point where you re in the clear to take your first dose but it should be manageable
fb6s200		getting the therapy you need while being stabilized on the med will be the key to long term recovery make sure you re getting to the root of why you became addicted to opioids in the first place
fb65pqv 	i eventually went on mat which is medicine assisted therapy
fb6alfg 	i checked myself in to get help in my own experience the first # months or so we are the worst i think it was just a matter of changing my lifestyle and surrounding myself with good decent people and deleting all my contacts and changing my phone number so i couldn t get anything if i wanted to
fb50vy5		just remember to stay hydrated otherwhise being active like walks etc helps too and for me hot showers are n # take a nice hot shower then jump right into bed 
fb53lz7  	staying active is definitely one
fb4z7z5		# say some positive affirmations in the mirror every morning # stop procrastinating # stay active bc boredom is a huge factor in using for me add onto that write every day for an hour set dedicated times for my small business # be more present in the moment especially with my sons take care
fb4v5sz 	i want to # be more patient and kind to myself others and my kids mostly # live in the present be less anxious about things i cannot control # find a house near the woods become closer to nature i hope we can both find the peace we seek
fb5vjt3 	after you make it through w d s please get some type of recovery program in place
fb4bgxc 	you will never get sober dating the man that hooked you on drugs why do you think he gave you drugs to tie you to him to make you dependent on him and he must really want you around to support your habit 
fb6753m 	if you actually want to get clean you are gonna have to ditch this guy if he is not ready to admit it is a problem and he is supplying you with drugs
fb4kyu9 	imo you have a great opportunity in moving away you have given yourself the ability to have some space unfortunately you have not quite realized that and are hanging onto this connection because you are not ready to stop yet if you deleted and blocked the connection it would be much easier to stay clean honestly
fb4kyu9 	i think that you should come clean to your gf take that first step towards recovery admitting powerlessness over opiates
fb48oyj 	the obvious answer is to come off asap and learn to accept that life will not feel as nice as it did when you we are high
fb48oyj		my advice would be to block this connects number and get on with your life without using you are heading in a bad direction
fb4gg9w 	use it as advised on the packaging to stop you crapping constantly but otherwise you gotta go through those wd s either way
fb44hup 	please be very careful when i was addicted to heroin another heroin addict told me about imodium but he told me to take tens or even hundreds at a time with ### mg cimetidine what i didn t know is that dosing more than the box says can stop your heart with no warning
fb3wmgl 	if you are really disciplined and taper your dosage down a few mgs a week under medical supervision i have heard it has worked for other people
fb3uqkc 	if you want to quit if you are really serious go to a state funded detox and then treatment best decision






Bad Advice: (e.g. imparting information that will be deleterious to patient recovery)
------------
fbgveyt 	it is true that some people shoot up heroin while listening to radiohead everynight for # years and one day quit detox for # days puke go on mat and # months later start hiking
fb7mb8x 	the only thing i did was smoke weed that is where i am at now and marijuana is slowly filling that hole as an altered state for handling life s pressures
fb70qsh 	i personally saw ibogaine as an answer there are others like that where you don t have to go out of the country if you can either get a doc to go along with this or can get by on 	fairly low dose of methadone then you can use methadone for it is intended purpose which is basically an assisted
fb70qsh		you can extract dmt in your home for a lot cheaper than an ibogaine trip dmt is also much safer than ibogaine
fb7c2q2 	i maintained with weed and mushies for about # weeks something in me just changed
fb98cri 	# nd time i took suboxone was the # mg ## hrs after taking a super tiny bump of h fent powder it was such a small dose it did not show up on my urine test
fb8iroq 	benzos just kinda make you sleepy sometimes not many people have that to compare to benzos in that case i would say go ahead and use them as long as you do not increase the dose at all
fb648qm		ween off from the subs as best as u can in my experience less than # mg didn t do much but u could try # first and see if it works
fb5rcqr 	i did a rapid sub taper had # sub strips did it like this day # # strip day # # # strip day # half strip day # # # strip day # # # strip day # # # strip day # and # just kinda did the rest of the # # strip as i wanted and i used some gabapentin and imodium
fb51nsl		i recommend xanax they seemed to help me get through the first week or so of wd
fb51mxg 	start off with like ### mg gababentin and see how you fell and maybe ### mg for the night
fb58p23 	## months sober mmt and cbt are my winning combo four months
fb4hsae 	if i could tell myself at ## something it would be to stick to weed and never know the joy pain of opiates 
fb3u32o 	you go to costco you can get a massive bottle for cheap it was not bad just be good about it probably a lot better than being stuck on subs



Universality: (e.g. validation, saying the patient is not alone in this)
------------
fbjeacd 	i am at the end of my tether myself and we all have our demons
fb7mb8x 	i know how difficult the search can be
fb6zksr		i ve also been the addict i know how much this hurts and i m so sorry
fb76zez		your in the home stretch another # days and you ll be done with the physical part another two weeks and you won t even look back
fb69xfd 	as a fellow addict i can relate the lingering thought of that short high
fb648s7 	i am feeling the exact same and i have been clean for almost just as long 
fb6s200 	my transition from heroin to suboxone was an easy one so i think you can relax
fb5t1b8 	i have been where you are at the very fucking bottom scared aching all over even in my heart sweating wondering when i was going to die nightmares and daymares not sure which was worse
fb6c4a6 	keep it up man it only gets better
fb5q6rz 	i know people say this shit but i think if i can do it then anyone can
fb5uxov 	i know it s easier said than done but if i can do it anyone can good luck with your recovery
fb5vjt3 	it s pretty cool on the other side of this deal
fb4clk3 	i wasted ## years of my life in basically your situation soon as i left i got clean
fb50qcz 	it s been ## years and i feel a lot better already you will too keep posting
fb4lc1s 	as somone with a similar history at that age now ##
fb4kyu9 	when i finally quit i had to move away and change my number and all my social media i basically had to preemptively make it impossible to get the drugs i wanted i totally ghosted all my old friends trust me if they use with you or sell to you they are not real friends
