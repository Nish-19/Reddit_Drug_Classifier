faq9sl9,Non_MET,i am not trying to discredit your pain condition idk why you thought that and i did not mean to discredit the struggle that is getting off traditional opiates and onto suboxone it is definitely not an easy act because while suboxone quells most of the withdrawals there is quite a few aspects of the withdrawals that remain and suck immensely and can last for what feels like forever and i am sorry if you do not like it being called a first step but there are not many more steps before the process of getting on suboxone sorry i get that you feel it is none of their business but it really is a big deal when someone has a potentially dependence forming drug at a na or aa meeting to the people that run the place they can get in trouble potentially for letting people with a prescription to such drugs into their meetings and the people who attend the meetings whether or not you think it is worse of a problem then yours is up to you i guess it is not like they are gonna say sign this contract that says you will not sell this drug to members your being triggered by the fact they will not let you participate i am sorry to say is not their problem does not mean they discriminate against people with pain conditions and also i do not believe you would sell it to the members i really never said you would it does suck to be in your position and i never said it does not but i am certain that with more research you will find some group for people currently struggling with pain and opioid addiction whether or not they are still on or off i am sorry but i cannot help you with this but i know a friend of mine who was getting off room with suboxone who found such a group where she lived and met with them every other day or so while she was getting sober off sub,346,25.76,51.16,70.77,1.32,346,15.9,91.62,63.87,19.08,11.85,4.34,0,4.34,0.58,2.6,7.23,5.78,12.14,10.69,4.34,8.67,5.2,19.36,4.34,2.02,2.6,0.29,2.89,5.49,1.16,4.34,0.58,0.58,1.16,15.03,0,0.29,0.58,0,18.21,2.89,0.87,1.45,4.05,2.02,8.96,2.89,0,1.45,1.45,2.6,0,2.6,0,0,7.51,2.31,1.16,1.45,1.73,1.16,2.6,13.87,2.02,10.12,1.45,4.91,3.76,1.45,0,0.29,0.87,0,0,1.16,0.58,0.58,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

faf24od,Non_MET,remember that all these opiates are basically the same as far as causing withdrawal symptoms codeine is mild and that is why you can buy it over the counter in some countries because getting off of it can be a little easier than say heroin but chemically it is all very similar a good effective way to realize the seriousness of any opiate is that they are just different doses of heroin it might not be absolutely scientifically accurate but for the addicts purposes it might as we will be so a codeine tablet is a small dose of heroin think of it that way and it feels different right someone posted that # weeks is not enough and they are right it takes about # weeks for the energy to really come back and you will be at about ## percent and then you get about # percent better every day for the next couple months be patient drink lots of water take lots of hot baths help immensely i took five in one day once just to feel better and finally your depression is part of the withdrawal even if you are naturally predisposed to being depressed it is exaggerated right now your concerns of wasting part of your life and a that are legitimate to a degree but you will see that in about a month that you we are worried about it way too much most of that depression and panic is not real it is like emotions in a dream they are temporary and they will fade i do not envy you on day # but try to get to day ## and see how you feel it is just one month good luck and remember those hot showers and baths and try soothing music classical if you are a fan at all,300,43.23,64.32,41.22,31.45,300,15.67,92.67,57.33,14,6,0.67,0,4,0,1.33,8,5.33,13.33,11,7,8.67,1.33,17,6.33,4.33,0.67,1.33,5,5.33,2.67,2.33,0.67,0.33,1,6.33,0,0,0,0,15,2.67,2,0.67,4.67,2,4.67,3,0.67,0.67,1.67,3.67,0,3,0,0.67,5.67,0.33,1.67,1,3.67,0,1.67,14,2,12.33,0.33,6.67,5.67,0.33,1.67,1,0.33,0,0,0.67,0,0,0.33,0.33,0,2.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.67

faf9rqr,MET,i recall the same feelings way back when i was a lot younger god i sound really old even to myself when people like jimi hendrix for example passed away the piper must always be paid no matter who you are and it is sad you have been through a great deal of loss without the prop you had when you we are using and that has to be very hard indeed i think perhaps you need someone to help you get to a place where you can see more clearly how much it has all affected you if this is only once a week talking to someone then try and find some counseling sometimes i would break every period of mourning because this is exactly what you are doing down into minutes when it threatened to overwhelm me instead of telling myself that was another day over i literally would try to live in each moment so i could tell myself that it had passed i work on a farm in the countryside mainly with the horses something i love and have done all my life from childhood and there we are many many times when even this became too much and i just wanted to stay inside the house with the curtains drawn having animals dependent on me and who i could not just leave to fend for themselves saved me even when i resented having to haul my arse out of bed and all those times when i would have one more coffee and one more cigarette in order to delay having to face the day grief is physical is not it not only a mental issue or is that just me i did not feel like appreciating the beauty of the countryside which i am still lucky to work in any longer and i stopped doing so it was not a conscious decision it just came under the general heading of grieving mourning depressed etc it lasted a long old time too eventually it returned but not without some help please acknowledge that you have been through a lot and try to take steps towards finding some help in order to deal with it you have done an amazing job in not going back to something you already conquered when you have had the perfect excuse to do so and you can conquer this thing you are going through now it just takes time as much of a clich this may be and please believe that it will eventually become less painful,424,24.91,45.31,84.63,18.79,424,14.39,95.52,63.21,17.69,9.67,5.9,0,3.54,0,0.24,8.02,5.42,12.74,12.03,9.2,7.31,2.36,18.63,4.01,2.36,3.3,0.71,4.95,4.72,2.12,2.59,0.47,0.47,1.89,7.08,0,0,0,0,15.57,3.07,0.94,2.12,4.72,2.36,3.3,1.65,0.47,0.24,0.94,2.12,0.47,1.18,0,0.47,6.37,0.94,1.89,3.07,1.42,0.71,5.19,10.61,1.89,16.98,2.12,6.13,8.73,0.94,0.24,0.71,0.24,0.24,0.94,0.47,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

faghrsv,Non_MET,oh i see that is very unfortunate because especially with a drug like fentanyl which is known for having a short half life and some of the worst withdrawals of any opioid you really cannot ween off of it if he is so stubborn about not getting medical help although i hate to mention it the next best thing is room if it is legal in your area i have had a horrible hellish experience myself with room worse than oxy and hydro withdrawal but realistically anything is better than a fent habit where you need to resize nearly hourly just make sure he does not up his dose that much while on it because it is can be in itself very hard to ween off of especially if you are getting on it from a high dose of another opioid people saying room has mild withdrawals are people taking # # # g dose a day or every other day or multiple very small # # g doses a day but he will most likely need to start on a # g dose and take it # # times a day if that is not enough and he does not feel enough effect after # h or so he should add an extra # # g to his dose after # # hours if it really does not curb withdrawals at all he should take an extra # g after that hour if it is too much and he feels euphoric he should reduce it by # g next dose this is not very much information and if he really wants to get better info he should check out the r room subreddit and do more research online especially about strains and their effects because the red white and green strains really do seem to vary a lot in effect i personally would say red borneo or bali would be best for someone already on opioids because strains in the white and sometimes green are less opioid like and more stimulating which is the last thing he needs if he changes his mind tho about suboxone that is really the best option he has,350,35.9,38.74,14.19,11.11,350,12,89.71,58.29,14.57,7.43,1.43,0,1.14,4.57,0.29,7.14,5.43,11.71,10.29,6.57,9.71,2,16,9.14,5.14,0.86,0.29,4.86,4.57,1.71,2.86,1.14,0.86,0,8,0,0,0,4.57,20.86,2.57,2.86,5.14,6.86,1.71,8.57,4,2,0.57,0.86,3.14,0,3.14,0,0,5.43,0.29,1.43,2,3.43,0.86,0.86,12.86,0.57,11.71,0.29,6.29,5.14,0.57,0,1.14,0,0.29,0,0.86,0,0.57,0,0.29,0,4.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29

fac0owo,Non_MET,room withdrawal was way way worse than oxy withdrawal for me i have heard plenty of stories of people switching from room to other opioids like tramadol because it was simply easier to quit honestly if you have a legitimate pain condition i would say room in very small doses with acetaminophen is way better and safer than prescription opioids but otherwise i would stay tf away from it i simply could not taper off of it because if i even lowered the dose a tiny bit # g a month i had frightening panic attacks along with all the stereotypical opioid withdrawal symptoms i eventually halved my # # g dose in a desperate attempt to quit and actually had to be hospitalized at one point because i went into a hypertensive crisis and had sinus tachycardia ### bpm after having a panic attack i was hospitalized # more times for similar reasons later room is great when it comes to it is safety in od but i would stay away from it regardless because regardless of what people say it is addictive and that is just the fact of the matter,188,70.78,21.24,65.58,7.4,188,19.15,90.43,55.32,12.23,6.91,6.38,0,0.53,0,0,5.32,5.32,15.96,10.11,4.26,7.45,0.53,15.43,6.91,5.85,1.06,0.53,2.13,7.98,3.19,4.79,2.13,1.06,0.53,3.72,0,0,0,0,12.23,0.53,2.66,4.26,1.06,1.06,5.32,2.13,0,1.6,0.53,7.45,0,7.45,0,0,6.91,0,1.6,2.66,1.06,2.13,4.79,7.45,0.53,15.43,2.13,11.17,3.19,0,0,2.13,0,0,0.53,0.53,0,0.53,0,0,0,3.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.72
fabz8c6,Non_MET,vyvanse is not going to harm your brain or something the problem with using stimulants after just getting off opioids is that your brain s locus coeruleus the part of the brain that regulates the release of norepinephrine is in overdrive which accounts for many of the withdrawal symptoms and symptoms post withdrawal if anything vyvanse is going to intensify the problem and worsen the psychological stress that is most likely what you are suffering from on top of that it may become an addiction on it is own because of it is powerful inhibition of dopamine reuptake potentially resulting in drug induced euphoria which is the last thing you need right now on top of all that since there is so much norepinephrine circulating through your system in withdrawal your heart is experiencing a lot of strain and vyvanse could potentially multiply that effect dangerously so what i suggest is going to an addiction specialist and getting a scrip for suboxone it is objectively easier to ween off of than other traditional opioids and it staves off withdrawal symptoms pretty we will i would not try self medicating with it because there is a wide dose range for it and buprenorphine it is active ingredient is a fairly strong opiate in it is own right you need to be in withdrawal to start taking it because if you take it otherwise it will induce withdrawal symptoms instead of reducing them i would stay far far away from methadone however and if you are doctor recommends it to you instead of sub propose sub to him yourself as an option wish you the best of luck i know the he will it is to be stuck in this shitty situation,286,69.05,62.36,13.33,8.87,286,24.13,87.41,56.64,16.43,6.29,1.4,0,4.2,0.35,0.35,10.14,5.94,16.08,8.74,3.5,6.64,0.7,15.03,4.55,2.8,1.4,0,2.1,6.29,2.45,3.85,1.05,0.7,0.35,5.94,0,0,0,0.35,16.08,1.75,3.5,3.85,5.94,0.35,4.2,0.7,0,0,0,7.34,1.75,5.59,0,0,6.99,0.35,2.45,2.45,2.1,1.4,0.7,9.79,2.8,11.19,1.75,7.69,1.75,1.05,0,0,0.35,0.35,0,1.05,0.7,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

f9msxwt,Non_MET,that sinking feeling about abstinence popped up for me for years i went through stretches without heroin amp on subs towards the end some of them we are pretty long i didn t see the point in quitting drinking or smoking because i d never loved either which is actually really wild logic why shouldn t i stop doing this thing i don t even like messed around with other stuff in these weird spurts a little coke crack mdma adderall xanax is no big deal i m a heroin addict and i haven t gotten high in months i d stop when each had escalated because all of them escalated and switch to something else i was looking at some old journals and i wrote during that time about being a former drug addict i felt proud and this felt so real but i also had these moments especially when i was stoned when i felt abruptly certain that i d eventually need to tap out completely eventually i went back to dilaudid and then heroin kinda like might as we will lived in a painful binge cycle til i finally just gave it all up i ve been totally clean for a few years and recognize my long stretches of substitution as almost more painful than my daily using years i was in school i had friends i had jobs i had a life when i was alone i felt vaguely afraid always scrambling a little looking for something heroin was always a couple inches away i didn t find relief from the painful part i just cleared up some space to see what might be worth living for couldn t figure out how to actually live i m proud of you for kicking fentanyl for ## days that s no joke i hope you stay curious and get support around how you want to approach this moving forward people are dropping like flies here it s gotten to the point where people don t even mourn anymore not in the same way everyone deserves better than this legacy our families deserve better please be safe glad you re here,359,47.78,20.95,97.83,67.86,359,15.32,85.24,52.09,16.43,10.58,8.64,0.28,1.11,0,0.56,5.85,3.62,13.93,5.85,9.19,6.41,1.39,13.93,5.57,3.62,2.79,0,3.06,6.13,4.18,1.95,0.28,0,0.56,3.9,0.28,0.28,0,0,14.48,2.79,1.67,0.84,3.62,2.79,3.34,3.34,1.11,0,2.23,4.46,0,3.34,0,1.11,5.85,1.11,1.39,1.39,1.67,0.84,6.69,4.18,1.67,19.22,2.23,9.47,8.64,0.84,1.11,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0.56,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56

f9lcz42,Non_MET,damn that is a tough one it is good to hear a voice from that side of it that is not in denial so i really appreciate your words it is been # months or so since i broke things off but i still feel pretty heartsick but i just came to the realization that what she needed was not me anymore and there we are things i just could not forgive the things i resorted to that got her to clean up her act location sharing having her show me her bank acct and such soured things for her she said i was trying to control her when in reality i think she was reacting to the loss of control in the relationship that she had kept with lies and manipulation i abhorred doing those things i am a thoughtful man i like to think but when trust is gone that thoughtfulness turns in on itself and becomes something unhealthy so it also helped me a great deal to end things because i had become something i hated a couple weeks ago my family celebrated my sister s birthday and then went to buy her oldest daughter a laptop to use when she goes to college next year she wanted an imac and when the screen came to life and i saw that messages icon in the bottom i wanted to run out of that store my palms got sweaty heart started racing it was no good it is weird because despite all this i know she has a good heart it is just turned around by her addictions and a lot of issues that stem from her childhood i tried so hard to get her to work on those and the failure of those efforts because she did not want to do the work left me a bitter man for some time i feel like i am coming out of that thankfully i am an addict i will always drool a little when i watch scarface so that side of things i could at least understand but the other guys including so much more that i have not mentioned and so much more that she never told me that was the dealbreaker for me when i had to sit back and think about what the future held so here is what i would say to you write her tell her everything and that means everything even the things that you do not necessarily have to reveal and even the things that might make her never want to be with you again i know i would love that though i do not expect to receive it and i do not know which way you are leaning staying single or trying to work it out with her so that may not be an option if it is single take some time to think about this and find the fruit that you can in the situation do not let it be something that loads shame on your shoulders only let it be something that makes you a little wiser but in any case if you ever want to quit and you need someone to talk to come here and post or message me i am always around,544,15.27,41.99,53.38,42.44,544,9.74,96.14,65.99,25.18,13.6,7.54,0,1.84,4.23,0,11.58,5.33,12.13,9.38,6.99,8.82,2.39,19.85,2.76,1.29,1.84,0.55,2.39,4.78,2.76,1.84,0.18,0.74,0.55,10.66,0.55,0.18,4.6,0.55,16.54,3.49,2.02,2.57,3.68,1.65,4.41,2.76,0.92,0.74,0.55,2.21,1.1,0.74,0,0.18,6.07,1.47,2.02,1.29,1.47,0.55,6.07,11.95,1.29,12.87,2.21,5.33,5.7,1.65,0.37,0.18,0.55,0,0,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18

f96l8ew,Non_MET,the drug in ambien zolpidem is used as a hypnotic because it binds pretty selectively to the part of the gaba a receptor that mediates sedation it is a pretty selective a# subunit agonist whereas anxiolytic effects of benzos come from agonism at the a# a# and a# subunits benzos also bind the a# subunit which is why they have a mix of sedative and hypnotic effects no doctor would prescribe it for anxiety b c it has no daytime indication and there are better meds for short term anxiety higher doses of ambien may lead to less selective binding and therefore more anxiolytic effect but the hypnotic side effects at those doses would be unfavorable so it is not an ideal drug for anxiety but there is still reason to believe that it has some anti anxiety effect certainly there are people who report less anxiety the morning after an ambien but for the short term anxiety of withdrawal a low dose benzo will probably work better and with a better side effect profile my view is that it is ok to take a benzo or sleep aid for a few days to get through withdrawal but it should not become a long term habit when people take benzos every day they grow tolerant to the anxiolytic effect and then dependent on the meds just to feel normal that is the last thing you need amp x### b my bad on assuming iv fent my impression is that pressed pills usually contain much higher doses of fentanyl than the equivalent doses of real pharmaceutics there is not a lot of detailed data on the composition of pressed pills and every batch may be different but people coming off street fentanyl have a really bad time whereas people coming off pharmaceutical fentanyl even in high doses like from tirf products do not seem to do any worse than people coming off equivalent doses of other pharmaceutical opioids when someone says they are taking six pressed oxycodone ## pills per day and their urine is positive for fentanyl negative for oxycodone they always seem to have a much higher opioid tolerance than they would have if their habit was actually ### mg oxycodone day so if you we are doing pressed fent but now doing real norco the latter will almost always be easier to kick just b c your tolerance is much lower it is possible there are pill presses in this country making low potency pills but that is not what i have seen ymmv,423,70.34,37.04,45.56,33.94,423,19.39,83.69,50.35,8.75,3.31,0.95,0,0.71,0,1.65,5.44,7.8,11.35,10.17,5.2,6.62,1.89,15.84,6.15,4.96,1.42,0.24,3.07,6.15,3.31,2.84,1.42,0,0.71,4.49,0,0,0,0,16.31,3.31,3.55,1.89,4.26,1.42,5.67,2.13,0.47,0.24,1.42,5.67,0.47,5.2,0,1.18,5.44,0,1.42,2.36,1.89,0.71,1.89,10.87,1.89,12.29,1.42,6.15,4.73,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0.95,0,0.71,0.24,0,0,3.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.07

f97cai7,Non_MET,yeah i am trying to just stop thinking about her but it is hard like i have been able to consciously stop ruminating about her and the past but seems like everything reminds me of her because of the way my memory works which is largely based on associating things with each other which is normally great my memory is excellent last night i had # separate dreams about her and like me chasing her and trying to get her back it is funny though because i woke up and was like thank god that was not real and i was not that stupid lol i do not think i would ever get back with her unless she seriously grew up and learned to let shit go i am not gonna lie and say i do not secretly hope for that but realistically i know she will not cos i do not believe she is capable of letting go and forgiving people i held on so long i think we both did to be objective cos i saw our potential if we both changed and that was a really great thing that from time to time would surface for an hour or a day and renew my desire to keep on fighting through her toxicity i think it was probably the same for her in regards to me being honest because i did lie to her a ton about my use and relapses and stuff because she would flip out and verbally and physically abuse me i have never been more frightened of a persons anger in my life and i am a very angry person to begin with we met at the worst possible time in our lives i wish i met her a year from now with us both having been clean that long lol but that is such a fantasy the odds of us both even getting clean for a year are about ## ## multiplied by each other so # # ## so absent an act of god fate destiny shit is not gonna happen i am trying to really believe that and stop fucking holding on to that naive hope it is not helping me stay clean that is for sure,369,25.08,24.04,69.85,45.69,369,12.47,94.85,63.41,20.33,14.36,8.4,1.9,0,4.07,0,5.96,4.07,14.09,10.57,5.96,8.94,2.71,21.14,4.34,1.9,0.54,0,2.17,7.05,4.07,2.98,0.27,2.17,0,8.94,0,0,4.07,0,16.8,3.52,2.44,2.44,2.98,1.08,5.96,0.81,0.27,0.27,0.27,1.9,0.54,1.08,0.27,0,8.67,2.71,2.17,1.08,1.63,1.08,5.42,11.92,2.44,12.74,1.9,6.5,5.15,1.36,0.54,0,0,0.54,0,2.17,0.81,1.08,0.27,0,0,2.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.44

f8nmdxr,Non_MET,previous commentators are correct you likely nodded out with something constricting blood flow to your arm that is why it feels like falling asleep on your arm because that is probably what happened it will probably get better over the next few days or weeks since you can move the fingers and have sensation even in the numb areas if you pinch them the damage probably is not too bad nothing you have said raises suspicion that you had a stroke or seizure neither of those things are very common with heroin fentanyl overdose strokes from heroin use are usually due to an infection on a heart valve from bacteria injected while shooting when septic emboli break off and block an artery in the brain which does not even happen that often more often they travel to the lung and because septic pe empyema some opioids can lower the seizure threshold but that would be a rare reaction to heroin or fentanyl overdose seizures are more common with cocaine or amphetamines hypoxic brain injury would not be limited to symptoms in one hand hypoxic brain damage causes symptoms like facial droop slurred speech trouble forming words trouble swallowing blurred vision difficulty thinking concentrating motor problems trouble with balance or coordination headache and so on similar symptoms follow a major stroke the hand symptoms you describe are far more likely to be from nodding out in a strange position that prevented blood flow to the hand than from the scary things you are worried about amp x### b i am glad though that this incident inspired you to turn your life around not to lecture but i hope you realize how lucky you are a few days of abstinence is long enough to lose a lot of your tolerance to opioids thousands of young people in the united states have injected heroin fentanyl after a few days abstinent and never woken up again lost tolerance and opioids of unknown potency are a recipe for fatal overdose so you are truly lucky to have woken up only slightly worse for wear i hope you never do this again if you do please stay safe do not shoot alone when it is your first shot after a period of abstinence always have naloxone and someone who knows how to use it good luck your whole life is in front of you you can do this,402,61.35,69.05,39.49,15.31,402,20.9,85.57,51.99,11.94,6.47,0.75,0,5.22,0,0.5,5.47,5.72,13.18,8.96,6.47,6.22,2.24,14.18,7.46,3.23,1.99,0.75,2.24,8.21,3.73,4.48,0.75,0,1,6.97,0,0,0,0,15.17,1.74,2.49,1.74,6.22,1.49,4.23,2.74,0,0.5,2.24,8.46,4.73,3.73,0,0.25,5.72,0,1.24,1,1.49,2.49,1.74,12.94,0.75,14.43,1.99,5.72,6.22,0.25,0.5,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75

f8hkl76,Non_MET,a few bits of advice i would not risk taking naltrexone without # days abstinence minimum for heroin i think you should try a shot or nasal spray of naloxone first you can get it free from many needle exchanges or sometimes you can buy it from pharmacy even without a prescription why because if you precipitate withdrawal with naloxone it will last an hour or so if you precipitate withdrawal with naltrexone it will last a day or so naltrexone will likely block the effects of imodium too i had a patient who tried to force himself to get through cold turkey withdrawal by taking naltrexone he also took a bunch of benzos and clonidine and other comfort meds including imodium in hopes of sleeping through the misery he wound up ruining his mattress because the diarrhea was so uncontrollable he stated that he would have killed himself if he had not been too fucked up to move as soon as he could sit up and hold a conversation he called his dealer the misery of taking an antagonist before you are fully detoxed will be ## x as miserable as ct withdrawal if you must try it try naloxone first at least it will wear off quicker and either wear a diaper or put some sort of protection on your mattress it does sound like you have gotten your tolerance pretty low for heroin use doing some arithmetic and making some assumptions like ## purity which may be too high i think your habit is probably equivalent to about ### ### mg of oral morphine per day if i had a patient on that dose of morphine i would have them taper down much further before they jumped off that said heroin addicts often have a better ability to tolerate withdrawal than pill addicts and withdrawal from that dose will not be as bad as withdrawal from a much higher dose of heroin but it will still be uncomfortable and some people just kick harder than others if you want to avoid most discomfort could you taper down further reduce by ## every few days until your dose is in the milligram range then if you jump the withdrawal will be next to nothing,371,58.91,63.71,8.96,5.57,371,18.6,87.33,55.53,13.48,9.16,1.62,0,4.04,2.96,0.54,4.31,5.12,15.63,9.97,4.31,9.16,1.62,17.25,7.55,5.93,0.81,0.54,4.04,5.66,1.89,3.77,2.16,0.81,1.35,9.16,0,0,0,2.96,15.9,1.08,1.89,4.31,7.55,1.08,6.2,1.35,0,0.54,0.54,6.74,1.08,5.39,0.27,0.27,7.82,0.27,2.16,2.43,2.16,1.08,3.23,8.36,2.96,11.32,1.08,5.12,5.12,0,0,0.54,0.81,0,0.27,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.5

f8hv3y4,MET,i am really sorry that you are struggling being sober please believe that this is the best thing for you there is a really good ted talk on addiction and what it really means and basically it says that environment and connections you have with people is what will get you through most people in active addition use because they are trying to escape their reality to find something better the only way to stay sober is to make an environment you want to be in and to make connections with people that help you to be better or to even get you out of the house to go for a walk or something it is so crucial to have friendships that are positive and give you something to strive for yes unfortunately you will have a period o tome when you are in withdrawals and when you are in a really bad state of depression and it is so hard to help yourself when the depression is winning but you have to take it day by day some days you will feel like you are winning and then sometimes the next day you will feel totally defeated it does not last you will totally overcome it the longer you are sober the easier it gets maybe look into doing some volunteering because just getting out of the house and having a purpose can really help to change your mindset it is also a stepping stone into the right direction small steps turn into bigger steps and if you do not take that first step towards something positive you will not get anywhere it is just like walking as long as you keep taking each step you will get to your destination look into counseling explore hobbies even if you do not think it is not for you just atleast try it you just gotta keep moving you got this i have been sober ## days i still struggle but i am getting there,333,24.45,90.16,63.84,42.09,333,14.71,96.4,63.06,18.32,10.21,1.2,0,8.41,0,0.6,8.11,4.8,12.61,12.31,7.81,8.11,1.5,23.12,6.01,3.3,1.5,0.3,1.2,5.71,3.3,2.4,0.6,0,0.9,12.01,0,0,0,0,14.11,2.1,2.1,0.9,4.8,1.2,4.8,1.8,0.6,0.3,0.9,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,10.51,0.9,3.6,3.3,5.71,0.6,0.6,18.02,3,15.92,4.2,7.51,4.5,0.3,0.3,0.6,0,0,0,0.9,0,0.6,0.3,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6

f7wozwf,Non_MET,if this is the butrans patch they last # days these patches are very low dose much lower than the sublingual bupe strips or tablets that heroin addicts usually take i just want to make sure you understand the difference in units the most common dose of suboxone contains # milligrams of bupe sublingual bioavailability is usually about ## the patch releases ## micrograms per hour ## micrograms is # ### milligrams over a ## hour period that entire patch will only release # ## milligrams of bupe the bad thing about the low dose patches is they usually do not cover all of a patient s withdrawal symptoms they just do not contain enough bupe the good thing about the patches is that they are almost like a semi bernese method i know a pain doctor who transitioned patients with both pain and addiction from pain pills to bupe using the patches because the patches release so little bupe at a time they did not need to go into withdrawal for bupe induction they would just put the patches on and the patches released so little bupe that it allowed a gradual transition each day he would add more patches when your patch is only giving you # ### mg per hour you are not going to precipitate a full withdrawal each hour you are releasing a bit more bupe and that knocks just a small fraction of any remaining heroin off the receptors idk how much a bag is but if it is as tiny an amount as commenters are making out you may not need to worry about precipitated withdrawal at all when people s total opioid tolerance is lower than the ceiling effect of bupe which is equivalent to about ## mg day methadone or ## ### mg day oral morphine or ## ### mg day oral oxycodone they can switch to bupe without precipitating withdrawal because the partial agonist activity of bupe is sufficient to keep them at the same level of opioid activity as their drug of choice was hope that makes sense,332,76.48,51.2,29.51,10.54,332,20.48,75.3,47.89,9.94,5.72,0.9,0,1.81,0.3,2.71,4.22,8.43,12.35,7.53,6.33,5.72,2.11,12.35,5.12,4.22,1.51,0,5.12,4.22,1.51,2.71,0.3,0,1.2,6.02,0,0,0,0.3,14.16,1.81,3.01,2.41,3.92,1.51,4.52,1.2,0,0,0.9,5.12,0,5.12,0,0.3,3.92,0,0,2.71,0.9,0.3,0.6,9.64,1.2,13.25,0.9,6.93,5.12,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0.3,9.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.94

f84k6eh,Non_MET,sure you wait as long as you can since the last time you used your doc drug of choice and then you take a dose of suboxone you wait as long as you can withstand the suboxone symptoms while it fills your receptors and then you use your doc which should take away the pain then you wait as long as you can again and take more suboxone and use your doc again as needed the idea is to fill up your receptors with suboxone while using yout doc to lessen the pain of inducting increase subs and lower doc eventually you just take the suboxone and do not use your doc it is not a completely pain free process but it is not as severe as regular induction i am not sure if i explained it we will feel free to ask questions,140,36.68,94.98,70.81,25.77,140,12.86,87.14,56.43,16.43,12.86,1.43,0,11.43,0,0,3.57,5.71,13.57,5.71,4.29,15.71,2.86,15,10,7.86,0.71,0,0.71,7.14,3.57,3.57,0,0,0.71,12.86,0,0,0,0,16.43,5,5.71,2.14,1.43,2.14,3.57,2.86,0,0,2.86,4.29,0,4.29,0,0,4.29,0,0,1.43,2.86,0,2.14,13.57,2.86,16.43,0.71,5.71,10,0,0,0,1.43,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

f7vgh6s,Non_MET,it s just really bumming me out i tested about it to my best friend last night and earlier she said she ll talk to me later about it over facetime it s too much to say via text in my head i m thinking we will i already vented somewhere else this is like my account no one knows is me but i wouldn t consider it a throwaway and i don t even wanna talk about it it s just upsetting as for xanax it really doesn t make me hungry lol i did get a medicine from my psychiatrist that i am supposed take at night which is the same medicine i mentioned above when i had hit ### lbs when my brother died because it makes you tired it s like trazodone but i just hate being unable to keep my eyes open and hungry she gave me a small amount to try though first i really should just use it i just again hate that tired and hungry at once feeling as for weed i hate it oh man i hate drugs in general oxycodone is the strongest i ve ever taken except dilaudid or morphine and that was only in a hospital setting but i just can t stand weed even cbd oil my brothers always high when he eats edibles he just constantly laughs he s smoked for so many years that i don t know when he isn t high i can tell when he s taken an edible though they make some really good edibles too i did have # pieces of a white chocolate one he got and i didn t taste even the slightest bit of weed my psychiatrist would get me a medical marijuana card instantly if i wanted she suggested it for my anxiety but i just don t need it anyway i m glad you re doing better and gained that ## lbs back i m also really proud of you for being off everything for a month it s not easy getting off subs is the hardest drug to get off of it s a shame i see people posting how their doctor prescribed it for pain management and it makes me wanna vomit because they see screwed in the long run no only will they eventually struggle getting off it but their opportunity of getting prescribed any opiate afterwards for their pain is so slim because suboxone is on their medication record i don t think it can be expunged it makes me cringe so bad and i wanna tell these people who post about it in the suboxone subreddit not to take it but it does help their pain and i m not gonna tell them not to take it if it works obviously ok i m done ranting again so proud of you for getting off everything especially suboxone because that s worse than getting off heroin i ve heard but def wouldn t know stay in touch with your weight gain we can be weight gain friends lmao,513,21.15,30.61,55.51,22.74,513,13.06,85.38,55.17,21.64,14.04,9.16,0.19,0.97,1.95,1.75,7.41,2.92,10.53,6.04,9.36,7.41,1.17,15.2,4.09,2.53,1.56,0.78,1.36,5.65,2.73,2.92,0.78,0.97,0,9.16,0.39,0.39,0.78,1.75,11.7,1.36,2.14,1.75,1.56,1.17,4.68,3.51,0.78,0.78,1.56,5.65,0.39,3.31,0.19,1.75,8.77,1.17,2.34,2.34,4.09,0.39,3.31,10.53,1.17,10.33,0.58,5.26,4.68,0.78,0.19,0,0.19,0,0.19,2.14,0.39,0.58,0.19,0.39,0.19,1.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.17

f7m0inf,MET,turn yourself in after you get clean and hire a lawyer i am in a similar boat right now where i am facing multiple felony possession charges already also have # on my record which i did ## months for so prison is a possibility too running from your situation and continuing to use is instinctual and that is okay but it will not solve anything and if you get in more trouble with the law by continuing this lifestyle then you are definitely going to prison and for much longer as for prison advice it really depends on what state you are in and what classification of prison you go to i can only speak for minimum security prison as that was my experience but provided that is where you end up which is likely assuming the charges are non violent you will be fine you are not gonna get raped at least which was my biggest fear mind your business do not gamble and if someone calls you a bitch or otherwise disrespects you hit them as hard as you can win lose or draw it does not matter as long as you show up but if you do not show up that will pave the way for you to be extorted and victimized minimums are pretty tame but they are still an entirely different world with a different set of rules also do not ask the guards for shit that you could ask someone else for make friends with people that are not scumbags and if you really need something go to them remember however that nothing is free or at least do not assume so when you make real friends they may help you for free but in the beginning be wary of anyone giving you free shit they will likely expect something in return and are doing it to put you in debt so they can later extort you start working out and get into shape you do not have to get massive but the people in prison who victimize people choose the weakest looking people to get at do not be one of them,359,25.06,73.92,62.07,25.77,359,14.48,91.92,61.84,17.55,10.86,1.95,0,6.96,0,1.95,6.69,3.62,13.93,11.7,4.74,10.86,3.06,18.94,6.96,4.74,2.51,0.28,1.67,6.13,3.06,3.06,0.28,1.39,0.28,13.65,0,0.56,0,0,15.32,1.39,1.39,1.95,5.57,0.84,8.36,1.67,0.84,0.28,0.28,1.11,0.56,0.28,0.28,0,9.47,0.84,1.11,5.57,1.95,1.11,1.67,14.76,2.51,13.09,1.95,7.8,3.34,1.39,0.28,0,1.67,0,0,1.39,0.84,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.84
